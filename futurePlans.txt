ðŸ’¡ When Would a Separate Draft Model Make Sense?
Only if:

You want multiple drafts/versions per blog (version history).

You have editorial workflows (author writes â†’ editor reviews â†’ publisher posts).

You want to keep saved changes separate from the live blog (like Wikipedia or Notion history).

Even then, versioning is often handled with a BlogVersion table â€” not a separate Draft.
